# ShortCuts

A mod that lets you double click any of the tabs on the Quick Menu to fire any of a wide variety of actions!

I'm looking for more actions that would be assignable to any of the tabs, here is what I have so far!
- Rejoin Instance
- Toggle Camera
- Open Worlds
- Open Avatars
- Open Social
- Open Settings
- Open Safety
- Open Gallery
- Toggle Sound
- Toggle Deafen
- Reload All Avatars
- Reload Your Avatar

If you have any suggestions for more actions please feel free to DM Penny#9538 or ping them in #mod-development, please just tell them your trying to suggest something or they may be very confused
